title: Touch sensing library
---

After I worked on <a href="/projects/assistive-robotic-arm-for-children">Emilie's assistive robotic arm</a>,
I thought it might be useful to easily reuse the Disney capacitive touch sensing thing for other applications.
After having found several attempts of putting Disney's science into a microcontroller library, `I decided to make one of my own`.
You can [find it on my Github here](https://github.com/ko-sinus/touche-library).

If you run out of ideas for using this on your own projects, just know that you can use `anything conductive`.
For instance, I have `some plants` at home that are now capable of `lighting some LEDs` when their leaves are touched.
I just plugged the sensor cable into the soil. I did the same during Halloween 2021 with pumpkins !
