Title: About me

I am a soon-to-be French engineer. Voilà.

My main interests lie in cross-disciplinary fields such as `Human-Computer Interaction` and `Human-Centered Computing`.
With a strong emphasis on the medical/healthcare fields, most of my projects consist of investigating anthropometrics in order to interact with data in a more tangible and physical way. You can find <a href="/projects">some of them here on this website</a>.

Reality is I spend most of my time drinking coffee.

I'm also a huge fan of music in general (I even play some from time to time).
Lately, I have developed a keen interest in the British jazz scene. We can also chat about that.

Please feel free to [reach me by email](mailto:message.koji@gmail.com>) if you feel like it.
