Title: About me

I am a soon-to-be French engineer. VoilÃ .

My main interests lie in cross-disciplinary fields such as `Human-Computer Interaction` and `Human-Centered Computing`.
With a strong emphasis on the medical/healthcare fields, most of my projects consist of investigating anthropometrics in order to interact with data in a more tangible and physical way.
My professional goal is to work for meaningful and challenging human-centered projects that can improve lives. You can find some of my projects here on this website.

Reality is I spend most of my time drinking coffee.

I'm also a huge fan of music in general (I even play some from time to time).
Lately, I have developed a keen interest in the British jazz scene. We can also chat about that.
