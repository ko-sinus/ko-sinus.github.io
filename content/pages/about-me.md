Title: About me

### I am a French engineer. Voil√†.

I am interested in `human-centered initiatives` that can improve day-to-day life.
With a strong emphasis on the healthcare field, most of my projects consist in `investigating anthropometrics` in order to `interact with data in a more tangible and physical way`. You can find <a href="/projects">some of them here on this website</a>.

Reality is I spend most of my time drinking coffee.

I'm also a huge music enthusiast (I even play some from time to time - I'm mostly into the new jazz scene). We can also chat about that.

Please feel free to [reach me by email](mailto:koji.andria@e.email) if you feel like it.
