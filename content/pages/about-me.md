Title: About me

I am a French engineer. Voilà.

I received my `MEng.` in `Mechatronics` and `Systems Engineering` from IMT Mines Alès, France, and my `MSc.` in `Health Devices Engineering` from Université de Montpellier, France, both in 2022.

I am interested in human-centered initiatives that can improve day-to-day life.
With a strong emphasis on the medical/healthcare fields, most of my projects consist in investigating anthropometrics in order to interact with data in a more tangible and physical way. You can find <a href="/projects">some of them here on this website</a>.

Reality is I spend most of my time drinking coffee.

I'm also a huge fan of music in general (I even play some from time to time).
Lately, I have developed a keen interest in the British jazz scene. We can also chat about that.
