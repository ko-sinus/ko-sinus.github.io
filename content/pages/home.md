### My name is `Koji Andriamahery`. 

I'm a `Hardware Systems Engineer` in the medical field. My main interests lie in cross-disciplinary fields such as `Human-Computer Interaction` and `Human-Centered Computing`.

This website enables me to write about <a href="/projects/">some of my projects</a>.
