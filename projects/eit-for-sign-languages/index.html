<h2>HumanLabs ?</h2>
<p>The open-source thing is actually a common aspect to all HumanLabs projects. If you don't know what HumanLabs are, <a href="https://myhumankit.org/en/home/">you can find more about them here</a>.
HumanLabs basically consist of Fablabs that are specifically dedicated to <code>assistive technologies</code>.
Their goal is to encourage people with physical disabilities to conceive and manufacture their own assistive technologies, using a classic fablab's equipment (3D printing, open-source electronics, ...).</p>
<p>Not only did I had the chance to work within one of them, but I actually worked in a specific one :
the HumanLab Saint-Pierre, located in the South of France, works closely with the <a href="https://www.institut-st-pierre.com/">Institut Saint-Pierre paediatric hospital</a>, and thus benefits from a dedicated medical team support (occupational therapists, ortho-prosthetists, doctors, ...).
This cross-disciplinary team setting was key for the success of this project, as it linked <code>traditional orthosis fabrication</code>, <code>3D printing</code> and <code>electronics</code>.</p>
<h2>Short context</h2>
<p>Emilie is a timid but lovely child who has an injured arm : <code>her right arm is paralysed from her shoulder to her wrist</code>, keeping her from any right elbow motion.
Before this project started, she had a traditional mechanical orthosis - she had to lock her injured arm with the other one on one specific position.
My role there was to propose a way to enable the elbow motion in the most natural way possible.
Fortunatly since she could still move her fingers to grip something on her right hand, I was able to propose <code>an arm positioning system using the very same injured limb</code>.</p>
<h2>Disney's magic</h2>
<p>After reviewing some interaction technologies, I decided to use <code>capacitive sensing</code> since it also resolved the direction control problem - flexion or extension.
As this project was not 'childish' enough, I based the touch sensing technology on <a href="https://la.disneyresearch.com/publication/touche-enhancing-touch-interaction-on-humans-screens-liquids-and-everyday-objects/">Disney Research Lab's Touché project</a>,
mainly because of the hardware simplicity (only passive components) - which enable efficient scalability and reproductibility at low cost, both essential for any open-source project.
Huge thanks to Danish makers <a href="http://blog.dzl.dk/">DZL</a>, <a href="http://www.hobye.dk/">Mads Hobye</a> and <a href="http://illutron.dk/">Illutron</a> for their preliminary work on bringing Disney's research into the maker world.
The final solution I designed consists of a <code>touch-activation mechanism which moves a linear actuator for arm positionning</code> (inspiration from <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/ourkidscandoanything/">Lorelei's project</a>).</p>
<p>If you want full documentation on this, you can <a href="https://wikilab.myhumankit.org/index.php?title=Projets:Orth%C3%A8se_de_Coude_Robotis%C3%A9e">directly head to this link</a>.
