		<p>A little while ago, I took what might be my biggest <code>non-technological initiative</code> to this day. During my 2nd year as a graduate student, I gathered a few of my classmates, some of my university's administrators, some CEOs and regional actors and a few brillant minds and I reunited them for a <code>TEDx conference</code>.</p>

<h2>TED and TEDx</h2>
<p>You might first want to know about TED and TEDx conferences (I understood they were quite popular but encountered several people who have never heard of them while working on this project). Basically, TED is a gloabl non-profit organisation that promotes <code>ideas worth sharing</code> (see what I did here) under short (&lt;18min) <a href="https://www.ted.com/about/conferences">engaging and inspiring talks</a>. Their official events usually involve a lot of major global players from different expertise areas (I won't name-drop here, I think is best for you to form your own judgement). This is their main activity ; one other responsibility they hold is to allow individuals to organise their own local version of a TED conference, <a href="https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/tedx-program">therefore named TEDx</a>. It is a great community, and a great opportunity for you to share to the whole world the everyday genius minds around you.</p>
<p>This exactly what I wanted to do at this time : gathering a few people around some values we considered worth knowing, and sharing to others what inspired us around us.</p>
<h2>How it all started</h2>
<p>An official TEDx event thus requires a TEDx license granted to an individual. I ended up holding one, and quite frankly, the history behind is nothing but ordinary. It all started after a normal grad student's day as I was searching for some tutorials to watch from a chemical class I was taking. Of course as usual when it comes to YouTube videos, I found nothing but everything else from what I was looking for. I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek4V62VJU7c">a TEDx talk from a french actor</a> - he was basically sharing how he got where he was, with nothing but dreams and perseverance. It's actually a popular TEDx talk, yet several things still sparked me. I won't go into a full analysis, but to me the thing was that :</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>he was particularly humble. He stressed that he wasn't more talented than others, that he was dealing with his own fears and inspirations (his entire talk even rely on a quote from Xavier Dolan), just like anyone.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>he was my age (still is, obviously). He is where he is because he knew what was driving him early, and never gave up.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>What he was doing didn't matter as I am not a cinema-goer. What really mattered was that he was doing it well, and he was doing it by simply being who he was. So when I asked myself what could I do with all of this inspiration and I saw that he intervened during a <a href="https://tedxmcgill.org/">TEDxMcGill</a> event, the answer was pretty straightfoward. The next morning, I talk of it with one of my classmates, and he agreed it could be cool to have one in our university. Because we had a gap in our schedule, we directly went to our university administrators office. In less than an hour, we were pitching this idea to the studies director. When I asked him "Why don't we have one already", I undestood "for no reason" as an answer. So I gathered a team, contacted TED and said I wanted to do just that. <code>TEDxIMTMinesAles was born</code>.</p>
<h2>How it all ended</h2>
<p>The theme : <code>« Alter-Natifs »</code> (french for « alternatives »), which is intentionally spelled as a combination of the words <code>« alter »</code> (that refers to "the other") and <code>« natifs »</code> (french for « natives »). In a way, this one word could literally means « born different », or « born in another way ». Under this theme <code>I wanted to illustrate change</code>, from its mechanism to its consequences, at different level and through different perspectives. I find the whole process of change very interesting as it leads to very specific and sometimes opposite behaviours. Just think about the last 20 years and how rapidly our society evolved looking at technology, economy, environment, individuals, … Note that <code>I am talking about evolution, which is unfortunately not necessarily linked to progress</code>.</p>
<p>There's a lot of ideas I wanted to stress under this theme. For instance, I thought of the way a society can <code>survive to change</code>. I thought it was important to stress how these last generations (particularly these ones but you can look at the bigger picture here) were born during a whole process of big changes on different matters. They are "born different" in a way, simply because they are born in an environment which is way (WAY) more different than before. They know how hard anticipation can be as they are considering time as a different concept than others.</p>
<p>An other starting idea I had is related to the birth of an idea. <code>The whole process of creativity</code> is something more and more important nowadays, and the notion of innovation was recently revisited (just think about <code>"low-tech"</code> or <code>design thinking</code> for instance). We are facing new technologies which are more and more connected to each other and we are constantly hearing about things like <code>artificial intelligence</code>, <code>industry 4.0</code>, <code>IoT</code>, … But do we need those to have an efficient systemic idea which satisfies the world ? How can we manage to think truely different in order to make something which has not happened yet happen ?</p>
<p>Finally, I wanted to talk about <code>recovery</code>. Sometimes we are born different, but sometimes accidents happen. Changes apply to different scales and this is particularly true at an individual's level. If someone who have lived their whole life in a certain way must face a brutal change he can’t avoid for some reason (accident, severe injuries, traumas, …), how can they recover ? Is returning to "normal" what is needed or wanted ? Of course it all depends on what you call recovery, which may be different from a comeback to "good old days". Also, this change does not affect only them but their whole entourage, and sometimes it can lead to an isolation from society. We tend to be more familiar with the concept of collaboration, whether related to economy, to scientific researches or even to places of work. <code>We do not hear enough of the « other side »</code>, we do not hear enough of isolation and its consequences.</p>
<h2>Closing notes</h2>
<p>Since <code>it was the first TEDx event of the city</code>, <code>and the second one at a regional level</code>, there was a lot of different stakeholders involved. Everyone had their own interest in participating in such an event. I realised what it meant to be lead organiser of a multi-disciplinary public event : being commited into something that is bigger that us, and having the responsibility to make decisions. These decisions were sometimes hard, sometimes easy, but these never were completely obvious as it impacted different people at different levels. This is key for making pertinent decisions : <code>managing consequences</code>. The more predictible the better, so we can evaluate risks and build bigger and stronger things on top.</p>
<p>I have fond memories of it as it enabled me to met incredible people who was doing incredbile work. At this day, TEDx events from my university are still organised every year by different teams of students. This is a pretty cool legacy.</p>
<p>Note that I could organise conferences without the TEDx label. However, I knew I couldn't engage with so many stakeholders without introducing something they'd at least partially already know. Also, recording talks was important to me. By the way, you can find interventions from the first edition <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOiyO46VJXTJgWL5rVUj1krZ4-17XhWLZ">here</a>. You can follow TEDxIMTMinesAles's future events <a href="https://www.ted.com/tedx/events?autocomplete_filter=TEDxIMTMinesAles">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you are curious about TEDx events and maybe thinking about organising your own, just know that everyone can do it. Really. Just like anyone has ideas : the difficult thing is to put everything in place to be able to give them life. But this is actually key. This is what makes what you care about different, and <code>this is how you can make it different</code>.</p>
