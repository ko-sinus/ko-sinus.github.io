Busy enough to hold its first \u0026ldquo;hackathon like\u0026rdquo; event, the so-called \u003ccode\u003efabrikarium\u003c/code\u003e.\nSince \u003ca href=\"https://myhumankit.org/en/home/\"\u003eHumanLabs are FabLabs specially dedicated to assistive technologies\u003c/a\u003e, their fabrikarium events consist of \u003ccode\u003eprototyping workshops dedicated to tackle disability-related issues\u003c/code\u003e.\nPeople from all over France came together in 4 teams of 10 makers, whether they be engineers, researchers, healthcare professionnals, students, retiree, etc.\nAnyone would be welcomed to contribute, as long as they have an some brain time to grant, a helping hand to give and a big warm heart.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince its a first (and undoubtedly not the last), it beneficiated from a pretty generous media coverage.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"fabrikarium\"\u003eFabrikarium\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe goal here is to resolve specific major issues in every-day life for the disabled : it may be the difficulty of driving a wheelchair when it rains, eating with full autonomy at any time or any place, or communicating easily with others when needed. It is about \u003ccode\u003eneed-led\u003c/code\u003e approaches : we start from real-life specific issues (that may be related to one specific pathology) that we actually can witness, and we are building our way up into a more global solution that can benefit to other disabilities. \u003ccode\u003eAccesibility is the guiding principle\u003c/code\u003e : solutions have to be wisely thougt and engineered enough to be cheap, easily reproducible and easy to use.

With a neat organizing team, we had the opportunity to work with the support of people from various organisations, including \u003ca href=\"https://www.ariane.group/en/\"\u003eArianeGroup\u003c/a\u003e, \u003ca href=\"https://www.inria.fr/en\"\u003eINRIA\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://fortil.group/\"\u003eFortil Group\u003c/a\u003e.

Affected by involuntary muscle contractions induced by dystonia, he could not control his wheelchair with his hands. Instead, he did it with his chin, thanks to an arm support which positioned a joystick under his head. The problem was someone else had to move it either in front of him for him to write or use a device, or on his side to be enable him to freely move around without the risk of stumbling over obstacles. Our main goal was to find a \u003ccode\u003esecure and easy-to-use solution\u003c/code\u003e to give him back his full autonomy. What we did consisted of \u003ccode\u003eusing robotics to automate the movement of his arm support at will\u003c/code\u003e, using an arcade push button (for full robustness over the years) on the side of his head that control a small linear actuator. We moduralized the whole mechanical assembly of his system as well, in order to enable easy and plug-n-play maintenance. Finally, we also had time to test an \u003ccode\u003eembedded voice user interface\u003c/code\u003e which worked pretty well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"next-steps\"\u003eNext steps\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOf course, the prototypes we developed will evolve over time and are not limited to this event. The idea was to give either a boost or a flying start so we can rapidly know which solutions best suit the interested parties. Once targeted, we can dress a full roadmap in which we can fit more prototype testing over time, under various situations. In my project\u0026rsquo;s case, it was clear that \u003ccode\u003eintroducing a microcontroler-based system opened the door of many exciting possibilites\u003c/code\u003e : home automation, new human-computer interactions for devices control, augmented environment awareness\u0026hellip; Knowing how driving and inspiring the project initiators (the affected student and his dad) were, I do not have a single doubt of how evolved they will make their system grow.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was curious to witness how a project can evolve in just 3 days in such a setting. Of course, I did not expect to see our prototypes growing so fast at that advanced level. But honestly, I was more surprised of how much the event was not about ideas and prototypes growth, but about meeting great, crazy-talented, and thoughtful people.

However, as they directly impact human lives, we may witness undesired consequences of their actions. In the field of autonomous vehicles, this is particularly relevant due to \u003ccode\u003enon-forgiving situations\u003c/code\u003e, where decisions that can irreversibly impact lives must be made in a split-second. Because we want those systems to be beneficial for individuals and society, there is a need for their decision-making process to be “good”, “right” or “fair” : in other terms, we need these systems to match our morality. The main question this reasoning rises is the following : whose morality exactly are we talking about? Who gets to decide which behaviour an artificial agent has to follow in order to be more ethical? As you guessed it, there is no universal agreement on what it means to be morally “good”. Several initiatives have proposed a converging set of ethical principles for ethical AI. However, systematic approaches to embedding these principles in autonomous systems face the challenge of disagreement between different ethical theories, i.e., \u003ccode\u003ethe problem of moral uncertainty\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Moral_Machine_Screenshot.png\" alt=\"The Moral Machine experiment\" title=\"The Moral Machine experiment.

This enables us to incorporate moral uncertainty by proposing a decision-making system that combines, \u003ccode\u003evia voting schemes\u003c/code\u003e, different ethical theories according to predicted credence levels of human agents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"discussions\"\u003eDiscussions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the Moral Machine experiment was criticized for its improbable realness or its relevance to morality, we argue among others that the experiment results are not to be taken directly and have broader applications as they are opening discussions concerning individuals preferences or value-sensitive design processes. The main purpose of our work was not to evaluate whether such situations can happen, but rather about giving a better understanding of ethical human decision-making process and proposing an implementation of human preferences regarding ethics into autonomous systems behaviour. Our study actually showed that the use of voting schemes in order to aggregate one\u0026rsquo;s preferences leads to more ethical decisions than original choices. We can therefore conclude that it is possible to make a decision that considers both a given set of ethical principles and human preferences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is so much things that can be further discussed here.

It is a great community, and a great opportunity for you to share to the whole world the everyday genius minds around you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis exactly what I wanted to do at this time : gathering a few people around some values we considered worth knowing, and sharing to others what inspired us around us.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-it-all-started\"\u003eHow it all started\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn official TEDx event thus requires a TEDx license granted to an individual. I ended up holding one, and quite frankly, the story behind is nothing but ordinary. It all started after a normal grad student\u0026rsquo;s day as I was searching for some tutorials to watch from a chemical class I was taking. Of course as usual when it comes to YouTube videos, I ended up watching anything else from what I was looking for. I stumbled upon \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek4V62VJU7c\"\u003ea TEDx talk from a french actor\u003c/a\u003e - he was basically sharing how he got where he was, with nothing but dreams and perseverance. It\u0026rsquo;s actually a popular TEDx talk, but to me the most inspiing thing was that he was my age (still is, obviously).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat he was doing didn\u0026rsquo;t actually matter (you guessed it, I am not a cinema-goer). What really mattered was that he was doing it well enough so that I could actually see him on stage, giving his speech while I was still confused about \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinodal_decomposition#:~:text=7%5D%5B8%5D-,Cahn%E2%80%93Hilliard%20model%20for%20spinodal%20decomposition,-%5Bedit%5D\"\u003espinodal decomposition\u003c/a\u003e. So when I asked myself what could I do with all of this inspiration and I saw that he intervened during a \u003ca href=\"https://tedxmcgill.org/\"\u003eTEDxMcGill\u003c/a\u003e event, the answer was pretty straightfoward. The next morning, I talk of it with one of my classmates, and he agreed it could be cool to have one in our engineering school. Because we had a gap in our schedules, we directly went to our university administrators office. In less than an hour, we were pitching this idea to the studies director. When I asked him \u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t we have one already\u0026rdquo;, I undestood \u0026ldquo;for no reason\u0026rdquo; as an answer. So I gathered a team, contacted TED and said I wanted to do just that. \u003ccode\u003eTEDxIMTMinesAles was born\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca data-flickr-embed=\"true\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/186411459@N02/49445548591/in/album-72157712848289357/\" title=\"TEDx IMT Mines Alès 2020\"\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49445548591_9497ab197f_z.jpg\" width=\"500\" height=\"332\" alt=\"TEDx IMT Mines Alès 2020\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cscript async src=\"//embedr.flickr.com/assets/client-code.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\u003c/script\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"how-it-all-ended\"\u003eHow it all ended\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince \u003ccode\u003eit was the first TEDx event of the city\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003eand the second one at a regional level\u003c/code\u003e, there was a lot of different stakeholders involved. Everyone had their own interest in participating in such an event. I realised what it meant to be lead organiser of a multi-disciplinary public event : being commited into something that is bigger that us, and having the responsibility to make decisions. These decisions were sometimes hard, sometimes easy, but these never were completely obvious as it impacted different people at different levels. This is key for making pertinent decisions : \u003ccode\u003emanaging consequences\u003c/code\u003e. The more predictible the better, so we can evaluate risks and build bigger and stronger things on top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have fond memories of it as it enabled me to met incredible people who was doing incredbile work. To this day, TEDx events from my university are still organised every year by different teams of students. This is a pretty cool legacy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNote that I could organise conferences without the TEDx label. However, I knew I couldn\u0026rsquo;t engage with so many stakeholders without introducing something they\u0026rsquo;d at least partially already know. Also, recording talks was important to me.

But this is actually key. Because in the end, it is all about how much effort you want to put it in.
