This can be pretty hard when it comes to artificial intelligence as it is closely embedded into a system and often act as a black box. The whole challenge is then about designing well-balanced human-AI systems such that meaningful human control is maintained, and humans are still responsible for the end result.

However, as they directly impact human lives, we may witness undesired consequences of their actions. In the field of autonomous vehicles, this is particularly relevant due to \u003ccode\u003enon-forgiving situations\u003c/code\u003e, where decisions that can irreversibly impact lives must be made in a split-second. Because we want those systems to be beneficial for individuals and society, there is a need for their decision-making process to be “good”, “right” or “fair” : in other terms, we need these systems to match our morality. The main question this reasoning rises is the following : whose morality exactly are we talking about? Who gets to decide which behaviour an artificial agent has to follow in order to be more ethical? As you guessed it, there is no universal agreement on what it means to be morally “good”. Several initiatives have proposed a converging set of ethical principles for ethical AI. However, systematic approaches to embedding these principles in autonomous systems face the challenge of disagreement between different ethical theories, i.e., \u003ccode\u003ethe problem of moral uncertainty\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Moral_Machine_Screenshot.png\" alt=\"The Moral Machine experiment\" title=\"The Moral Machine experiment.

We tested our method using MIT’s Moral Machine Experiment as a data source : our goal was to repurpose the well-known trolley dilemma towards means to understand and estimate \u003ccode\u003eone’s credence towards normative ethical theories\u003c/code\u003e. This enables us to incorporate moral uncertainty by proposing a decision-making system that combines, \u003ccode\u003evia voting schemes\u003c/code\u003e, different ethical theories according to predicted credence levels of human agents.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"discussions\"\u003eDiscussions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile the Moral Machine experiment was criticized for its improbable realness or its relevance to morality, we argue among others that the experiment results are not to be taken directly and have broader applications as they are opening discussions concerning individuals preferences or value-sensitive design processes. The main purpose of our work was not to evaluate whether such situations can happen, but rather about giving a better understanding of ethical human decision-making process and proposing an implementation of human preferences regarding ethics into autonomous systems behaviour. Our study actually showed that the use of voting schemes in order to aggregate one\u0026rsquo;s preferences leads to more ethical decisions than original choices. We can therefore conclude that it is possible to make a decision that considers both a given set of ethical principles and human preferences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere is so much things that can be further discussed here.

Their official events usually involve a lot of major global players from different expertise areas (I won\u0026rsquo;t name-drop here, I think is best for you to form your own judgement). This is their main activity ; one other responsibility they hold is to allow individuals to organise their own local version of a TED conference, \u003ca href=\"https://www.ted.com/about/programs-initiatives/tedx-program\"\u003etherefore named TEDx\u003c/a\u003e.

I ended up holding one, and quite frankly, the story behind is nothing but ordinary. It all started after a normal grad student\u0026rsquo;s day as I was searching for some tutorials to watch from a chemical class I was taking. Of course as usual when it comes to YouTube videos, I ended up watching anything else from what I was looking for. I stumbled upon \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek4V62VJU7c\"\u003ea TEDx talk from a french actor\u003c/a\u003e - he was basically sharing how he got where he was, with nothing but dreams and perseverance. It\u0026rsquo;s actually a popular TEDx talk, but to me the most inspiing thing was that he was my age (still is, obviously).\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat he was doing didn\u0026rsquo;t actually matter (you guessed it, I am not a cinema-goer). What really mattered was that he was doing it well enough so that I could actually see him on stage, giving his speech while I was still confused about \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinodal_decomposition#:~:text=7%5D%5B8%5D-,Cahn%E2%80%93Hilliard%20model%20for%20spinodal%20decomposition,-%5Bedit%5D\"\u003espinodal decomposition\u003c/a\u003e. So when I asked myself what could I do with all of this inspiration and I saw that he intervened during a \u003ca href=\"https://tedxmcgill.org/\"\u003eTEDxMcGill\u003c/a\u003e event, the answer was pretty straightfoward. The next morning, I talk of it with one of my classmates, and he agreed it could be cool to have one in our engineering school. Because we had a gap in our schedules, we directly went to our university administrators office. In less than an hour, we were pitching this idea to the studies director. When I asked him \u0026ldquo;Why don\u0026rsquo;t we have one already\u0026rdquo;, I undestood \u0026ldquo;for no reason\u0026rdquo; as an answer.

Everyone had their own interest in participating in such an event. I realised what it meant to be lead organiser of a multi-disciplinary public event : being commited into something that is bigger that us, and having the responsibility to make decisions. These decisions were sometimes hard, sometimes easy, but these never were completely obvious as it impacted different people at different levels. This is key for making pertinent decisions : \u003ccode\u003emanaging consequences\u003c/code\u003e. The more predictible the better, so we can evaluate risks and build bigger and stronger things on top.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have fond memories of it as it enabled me to met incredible people who was doing incredbile work.

However, I knew I couldn\u0026rsquo;t engage with so many stakeholders without introducing something they\u0026rsquo;d at least partially already know. Also, recording talks was important to me.

But this is actually key. Because in the end, it is all about how much effort you want to put it in.
